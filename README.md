Parkour Warrior 28 is a map for 1.19.3, which is a replica of [Noxcrew's](https://noxcrew.com/) Parkour Warrior map played in their event, Minecraft Championship, 28. Parkour Warrior 28 offers a challenging course, with which even those who are great at the movement aspect of Minecraft *will* struggle. So what are you waiting for? Take upon the daring challenge of the Ninja frogs and prove that you too can be a Parkour Warrior!

This Parkour Warrior **will** feature:

- **Three modes**: Run (Unsynchronised and Synchronised) and Practice.
  1. Unsynchronised Run provides players with their own infinite timer and focuses on **CPM** (Coins Per Minute). Try to finish as much as fast as you can! If you feel like you're underperforming, you can **reset** your run. From Unsynchronised Run, players can switch to...
  2. Practice gives players the opportunity to retry certain elements over and over again, utilising **skip section**, **re-do (or go to previous) section** and **reset run**. Time doesn't matter in Practice, nor are there any rewards.
  3. By enabling Player Synchronisation, Players are all forced into the third mode: Synchronised Run. Synchronised Run offers an identical (with your customised preferences) to the *real* event experience. You are granted with X minutes during which you must try to get as much coins as possible, with Y time in Overtime in case you might need it.
  
  All of the modes feature standard Parkour Warrior mechanics (such as Scrolls), although their interface deviates from one another.
- **Cosmetic and individual gameplay customisation**: Players can unlock cosmetics (hats, trails, and particles) by completing **challanges** or buying them for the coins they have acquired from their runs. Players will also be able to tune their gameplay: disable the soundtrack, bossbars, give themselves night vision, etc, as well as simply change their team for... a useless, unless synchronised, colour. 
- **A thought through UI**: Unlike my previous map, this one will innovate the way players interact with the map, with more, than a "relatively simple" Control Book.

Parkour Warrior will have more subtle details, but so far in development, this is all I have come up with.

**Q:** When and where will the map come out?\
**A:** It is too early in development to give an accurate prediction for when the map will get released. And believe me, when it will be nearly finished - you **will** get to know. I plan to publish the map both on YouTube and Planet Minecraft, you will be able to download it from here, dropbox and google drive.

**Q:** Where can I contact you?\
**A:** You can't. Unless you know certain people or are willing to stalk for me on social media, there isn't really a way to get to me besides leaving comments under my videos/community posts.

**Q:** Can I help the development process in any way?\
**A:** Yes, you can. As I am trying to fulfill a *certain-amount-of-content-goal*, by submitting your ideas on Community posts or *somehow accessing me on other social media*, you help a lot by reducing the amount of things I need to personally come up with, credits *will be provided* (if, the idea, of course, is found appaling enough and hadn't been thought before of being implemented).

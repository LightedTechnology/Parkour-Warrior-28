  This week of development, compared to the previous one, really wasn't *that* productive. Reason for that being that this week, a pretty significant affair will be held, the yearly English a-la tournament amongst all schools of our county to derive the best englishman (or, in my case, woman) from the crowd of students pursuing advanced degrees. With all of my focus and dedication funneled to that, nevertheless, I have introduced *auras, trails, leaderboards and timers* and, well, spent two hours yesterday breaking down over how on earth embed resourcepack shaders are even meant to work. Not much, I know, still, best I could do given the circumstances.

Parkour Warrior 28 is a map for 1.19.3, which is a replica of [Noxcrew's](https://noxcrew.com/) Parkour Warrior map played in their event, Minecraft Championship, 28. Parkour Warrior 28 offers a challenging course, with which even those who are great at the movement aspect of Minecraft *will* struggle. So what are you waiting for? Take upon the daring challenge of the Ninja frogs and prove that you too can be a Parkour Warrior!

This Parkour Warrior **will** feature:

- **Three modes**: Run (Unsynchronised and Synchronised) and Practice.
  1. Unsynchronised Run provides players with their own infinite timer and focuses on **CPM** (Coins Per Minute). Try to finish as much as fast as you can! If you feel like you're underperforming, you can **reset** your run. From Unsynchronised Run, players can switch to...
  2. Practice gives players the opportunity to retry certain elements over and over again, utilising **skip section**, **re-do (or go to previous) section** and **reset run**. Time doesn't matter in Practice, nor are there any rewards.
  3. By enabling Player Synchronisation, Players are all forced into the third mode: Synchronised Run. Synchronised Run offers an identical (with your customised preferences) to the *real* event experience. You are granted with X minutes during which you must try to get as much coins as possible, with Y time in Overtime in case you might need it.
  
  All of the modes feature standard Parkour Warrior mechanics (such as Scrolls), although their interface deviates from one another.
- **Cosmetic and individual gameplay customisation**: Players can unlock cosmetics (hats, trails, particles, and holdables) by completing **challanges** or buying them for the coins they have acquired from their runs. Players will also be able to tune their gameplay: disable the soundtrack, bossbars, give themselves night vision, etc, as well as simply change their team for... a useless, unless synchronised, colour. 
- **A thought through UI**: Unlike my previous map, this one will innovate the way players interact with the map, with more, than a "relatively simple" Control Book. The UI will provide players with the ability to customise their own gameplay, appearance, and for those with admin permission, even the game itself (to an extent, which is far less than bb19)

Parkour Warrior will have more subtle details, but so far in development, this is all I have come up with.

**Q:** When and where will the map come out?\
**A:** It is too early in development to give an accurate prediction for when the map will get released. And believe me, when it will be nearly finished - you **will** get to know. I plan to publish the map both on YouTube and Planet Minecraft, you will be able to download it from here, dropbox and google drive.

**Q:** Where can I contact you?\
**A:** You can't. Unless you know certain people or are willing to stalk for me on social media, there isn't really a way to get to me besides leaving comments under my videos/community posts.

**Q:** Can I help the development process in any way?\
**A:** Yes, you can. As I am trying to fulfill a *certain-amount-of-content-goal*, by submitting your ideas on Community posts or *somehow accessing me on other social media*, you help a lot by reducing the amount of things I need to personally come up with, credits *will be provided* (if, the idea, of course, is found appaling enough and hadn't been thought before of being implemented).
